If consumed == 0 on line 86 then we increment pos on line 89. Pos appears to always be incremented at a value of greater than or equal to one for every character in the input.

I think  output  would have been a better choice. (Actually; upon looking it up I see Java does not have  out  but since most programmers have experience in more than 1 language I still find it confusing; but this is just nitpicking)    I also am not sure what .escapeCsv() does or how translate would be getting called from your test; nor am I particularly familiar with Java. If one of the strings needs .escapeCsv(); does the other? Does .escapeCsv() call translate? I am assuming it must.    A line number for the error would be helpful.    On line 85; translate is being passed 3 arguments when it only takes 2 parameters. I m not sure how this is possible. Its return value is also being assigned to the int  consumed  yet it is a void function. Furthermore; the function seems to be recursively calling itself in a way that would not advance progression (still with incorrect arguments).    On first call of translate; for example; it would; itself; call translate with  (input; 0; out) which are invalid arguments and would just lead to translate calling itself again with the same arguments. I can see in the loop where pos WOULD increment but it recursively calls Translate first.    I am assuming I am just missing some of the ins and outs of Java; so anyway;  the only thing I can guess might be wrong with out is that translate it passing it as a third parameter to itself with no apparent override that actually takes 3 parameters.,1436373417884.0,C#,Hobbyist,Male,Web,3.0,US,28.0,true,false,true,true,true,4.0,331579.0,I realize it is done intentionally; but it would be nice to see all of the source code involved!,,,75,80,2.0,16.0,55.35090589819677,1.0,1.0,657,10.0,340.0,1991.7135383433747,23.0,16.0

I suspect java has representations for both -0.0 and 0.0 for floating point numbers but not integers. The code on line 260 may not even get execute because the block starting at line 247 may never be entered. After the explicit conversion to a long and then the implicit conversion back to a double for the comparison I think you may end up with the test 0.0 == -0.0 we I imagine would evaluate to false. If this is the case then line 263 gets executed and I suspect String.valueOf(x) is converting -0.0 to 0.    If the code block on line 247 is entered then I suspect the issue is line 248. I believe longs only have one representation for zero so the cast converts -0.0 to 0.

We check that mantissa / 10 * 10^(exp+1) == value (i.e. is the value of  mantissa  actually the significant digits of value); and if it is; we divide mantissa by 10 and increment exp.

To me; it seems as if the array variable here is not the problem as the values and methods it s using and dealing with are seemingly valid - but I m not sure where else in your code the exception is except that the parameters you re passing to these two assert parameter array initializations would be the likely suspect. I was wondering if this toClass method is an overload of the ClassUtils method toClass since you re using the ClassUtils object as the second parameter of your assert here. ,1436311212648.0,C++,Hobbyist,Male,Web,5.0,united states,36.0,true,true,true,true,true,5.0,128103.0,I think you might have mixed up the files or something as the test code did not point to anything in the lower code section.,,,902,50,1.0,14.0,39.302968908806456,1.0,1.0,284,8.0,146.0,686.2641988485997,11.0,9.0

The one you show takes a TimePeriodValue. (wrong number of arguments). Assuming that SimpleTimePeriod is a subclass of TimePeriodValue; the first arg would be an ok type.  According to the web; these classes are from org.jfree.data.time on jfreechart.  The top line of SimpleTimePeriod is public class SimpleTimePeriod implements TimePeriod; Comparable; Serializable. The top line of TimePeriodValue is public class TimePeriodValue implements Cloneable; Serializable so STP is not a subclass of TPV and you are showing us the wrong add method.     The period of the TPV is sent to updatebounds and you likely needed to show us the TPV constructor so we knew which input the period was (0L or 50L).   public TimePeriodValue(TimePeriod period; Number value) {          if (period == null) {              throw new IllegalArgumentException( Null  period  argument. );          }          this.period = period;          this.value = value;      }  What we actually have is two longs from STP  public SimpleTimePeriod(long start; long end) {          if (start > end) {              throw new IllegalArgumentException( Requires start <= end. );          }          this.start = start;          this.end = end;      }  btw; here is the documentation link on the web. Since you are studying tool usage.. thats the tool i m using. http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/api/javadoc/index.html    Your add method seems to want to pass a whole time period (the whole STP) and the number of items-1 (aka 0) in the set of time periods... ok.. calling updatebounds on the whole STP and 0.    we ll also need getMaxMiddleIndex() which is not shown here.  The documentation says  Returns the index of the time period with the maximum middle milliseconds.  there is only one time period in this set so its gotta be the index of this time period.    Unfortunatly I m not finding code for TimePeriodValues; just TimePeriodValue and SimpleTimePeriod so I m unsure what the min and max start indexes are. Really; if one of my students gave me this and asked for help; I d make them show me the relevant code and have them handtrace thru it. Its rather annoying doing this without the actual code that it calls. I m stopping.

I think using a different name would make the code more readable; and enable someone maintaining the code to have a better shot at understanding it and fixing it. Perhaps you have to define array to be of type Object instead of assuming it s actually an array of some type like String if you re going to let folks call it with a null array.  Then the cast won t fail; and you can go through further steps to find out IF its class is Array; an then if so you can get the class of the first array object to figure out it s a String.

No; there s nothing directly wrong with how getClass is being used in that statement per se.  However; the choice to use it and/or the generics in general is clearly at the heart of the failures.

Because the output indicates the code compiles and doesn t receive a runtime exception.    Assuming the method with the signature TimePeriodValues.add(SimpleTimePeriod; double) is calling updateBounds(TimePeriod; int); this seems a little off because updateBounds takes an int.

However; the logic at line 3288 that sets  type  (which copyArrayGrowl() uses) sets it to a basic Object type since both the array and the value are null. Typically; copyArrayGrowl() would match the array type; but since the array is null it uses the value that we pass from  type  to create it.

This value gets passed to copyArrayGrowl() which returns a copy of the array.     The  type  that s set in this line would usually be a backup value in case the array is null; but since the array is both null and the  type  value passed is a basic Object type; the array that s returned is an Object[] array; causing the failure later on.,1436671295263.0,C#; Python,Professional_Developer,Male,High_School;University;Web,12.0,United States,27.0,true,true,false,true,true,4.0,138398.0,One thing I've noticed as I've done more of these HITs -- I tend to explain the whole problem in the first response.

This value is only used in two places; neither of which would cause a problem with the code.    First; it is used for the  type  variable where its type is checked so it can be passed to copyArrayGrowl(). Second; it is passed when the copyArrayGrowl() method is called so the method can return a copy of it. Both of these are legitimate uses even when null arrays are passed (like our case); and the failure would not be caused by it.    However; you could argue that since this generic argument is allowed; the failure occurs later on.
